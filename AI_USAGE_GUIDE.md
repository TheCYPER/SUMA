# SUMA LMS AI Usage Guide

## Overview

SUMA LMS's AI system is a responsible educational AI platform designed to help students learn and grow, not to replace the learning process. Our AI system uses a multi-agent architecture to ensure education-oriented assistance.

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Education-Oriented
- **Guide Learning**: Help students think through questions and guidance
- **Develop Abilities**: Improve students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills
- **Promote Understanding**: Help students understand concepts rather than memorize answers

### Responsible Use
- **Prevent Academic Misconduct**: Do not provide direct homework answers
- **Encourage Originality**: Guide students to express their own ideas
- **Academic Integrity**: Maintain academic integrity and ethical standards

## ü§ñ AI Agent System

### 1. Learning Mentor
**Role**: Provides learning strategies and guidance
**Use Cases**:
- Create study plans
- Improve learning methods
- Develop study habits
- Analyze learning progress

**Example Conversation**:
```
Student: I want to improve my learning efficiency
AI: I'd be happy to help you improve your learning efficiency! Let's first understand your learning situation:
1. What are your current learning goals?
2. What aspects do you think need improvement?
3. What learning methods have you tried?
```

### 2. Concept Explainer
**Role**: Explains complex concepts and theories
**Use Cases**:
- Understand abstract concepts
- Clarify theoretical points
- Build knowledge connections
- Illustrate with examples

**Example Conversation**:
```
Student: What is machine learning?
AI: Machine learning is a fascinating concept! Let me explain it in simple terms:
Machine learning is like teaching computers to learn, just like we humans learn.
Can you tell me what you understand about the word "learning"? This way I can better explain machine learning.
```

### 3. Problem Guide
**Role**: Guides students to think about problems
**Use Cases**:
- Analyze problem structure
- Break down complex problems
- Provide thinking frameworks
- Encourage experimentation

**Example Conversation**:
```
Student: I can't solve this problem
AI: I understand you're having difficulties. Let's analyze it step by step:
1. What does this problem require?
2. What methods have you tried?
3. At which step did you get stuck?
4. Do you remember related concepts or formulas?
```

### 4. Writing Assistant
**Role**: Helps improve writing skills
**Use Cases**:
- Improve article structure
- Enhance expression skills
- Provide writing frameworks
- Language polishing

**Example Conversation**:
```
Student: Help me write a paper
AI: I can help you improve your writing skills, but I can't write content directly. Let's discuss first:
1. What is your paper topic?
2. What viewpoints and evidence do you have?
3. What structure do you want to use?
4. What writing difficulties are you facing?
```

### 5. Code Reviewer
**Role**: Reviews and improves code quality
**Use Cases**:
- Code quality and standards review
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Best practices guidance
- Debugging help

**Example Conversation**:
```
Student: Help me write code
AI: I can help you improve code quality, but I can't write code directly. Let's look at:
1. What is your coding approach?
2. What methods have you tried?
3. What errors are you encountering?
4. What functionality do you want to implement?
```

### 6. Learning Analyst
**Role**: Analyzes learning progress and effectiveness
**Use Cases**:
- Learning trajectory analysis
- Identify weak areas
- Personalized recommendations
- Progress assessment

**Example Conversation**:
```
Student: Analyze my learning situation
AI: Let me help you analyze your learning situation. Please tell me:
1. What content have you learned recently?
2. Which aspects do you think you've mastered well?
3. Which aspects still need strengthening?
4. What are your learning goals?
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Guardrail System

### Violation Detection
The system automatically detects the following behaviors:
